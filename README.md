This site's purpose was to test the skills I learned in class and put everything into practice. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS in this class and this site is a tribute to all the topics we went over. Though barebones, it is a great starting point for someone like myself who wants to be well acquainted in the tech sphere. Though website development is not high on my list of what I want to do with my life and career, I think it is a valuable skill to have and definitely an interesting topic to explore. I’m proud of how far I’ve come in such a short time and look forward to my long future in the coding world. 

In this project, the theme was a light blue and gray contrast with white and dark blue lettering depending on the background of the words. The colors I used for this site were #A0CFE6 for my light blue background, #333 for my dark gray borders and Nav bar, #f5f5f5 for my white lettering, and #2394EB for my darker blues. 

All of the content that wasn’t mine on the site came from one of my favorite bands, Mastodon. Here is a link to their website https://www.mastodonrocks.com/ and a link to their youtube channel where my video came from https://www.youtube.com/@mastodon
