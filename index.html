                <p>
                    Growing up I was a very happy child and it all changed once I got a little older and realized the world wasn’t so pretty. I went through some serious bouts with my mental health and at times I felt like giving up completely. With some help from family, friends, and a very talented support team, I’ve been able to make many changes that allowed me to love myself more and grow. I have some new challenges now, as becoming an adult is scary and everyone seems like they’re out to get me and watch me fail. I have to remind myself that I have many people who love me and would like nothing more than to see me suceed. I have a long way to go and a lot I want to get done before I go, but at the rate I’m going now, I’ll get that done and more!

                <h2>The History of the Hamburger Icon</h2>
                <img src="/img/icons8-menu (3).svg" alt="three lines on top of eachother. Also known as the hamburger icon">
                <div>
                    <p> The hamburger icon is one of the most recognizable elements of modern web design and a personal favorite aspect of my website. This little hamburger has changed the way people navigate mobile and even desktop websites, and from the looks of it, it will stick around. It was a little rough getting it working on my site but after a lot of tweaking in CSS, I was able to not only get it working, but make it look quite nice on my site. When I first learned the name of the icon, the name immediately reminded me of the styles of folding paper I learned in grammar school; the hotdog and the hamburger. This however, had little to do with the icon’s shape or makeup.</p>
                    <p> The hamburger Icon traces its roots back to 1981, designed by Norm Cox as part of the design for the Xerox Star personal computer. He wanted to make a symbol “road-sign simple” to help the computing world, at least for Xerox at the time, have a simple and recognizable symbol for selecting the menu of a program, as the internet as we know it today wasn’t even around yet! Microsoft later adopted the symbol for their early Windows operating systems, but it wasn’t until 2009 when the icon made its biggest leap yet onto mobile phone compatible websites.</p>
                    <p>The icon got its design, the famous three identical bars on top of eachother, not from the hamburger, but from the basic look of a list. When the icon was created, computer graphics would only allow Cox to work with a 16 pixel system, resulting in the famous “road-sign simple” icon we know and love today. The nickname only came much later when programmers came up with it as sort of an inside joke. That nickname stuck whether Cox liked it or not.</p>
                    <p>When working on implementing the icon, I was almost surprised that it wasn’t built into the language with how common it is in modern web design. I had to find a free, copyright safe SVG from the internet to put the thing in. Having heard from a friend who previously took this class that the hamburger icon was a pain to get working, I didn’t understand at first because there was a pretty short guided video provided for us on how to get it working. I thought that if I just followed the video to a T, I would be able to get it working no problem. However, the video and I butted heads a little on the process and I was left to do a lot of fine tuning myself to really get It working. I had to change some elements around because the video set up their nav bar differently than I did. I made different names for my classes and IDs so I couldn't just copy the video directly. I got stuck sometimes but with the knowledge I had of web development and flex box that I learned from class, I was able to know what elements I should be switching up After about 30 minutes, I can not describe the relief I felt when I finally got it in.</p>
                    <p>Having learned more about the history, and having got one of my very own working on my site, I have a whole new respect for that little icon. It really changes the game, especially for mobile websites. I’m really proud of what I’ve done and maybe in the future I’ll learn even more about it.</p>
                    <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed reading and I hope I taught you something new!</p>
