                <p>
                    Growing up I was a very happy child and it all changed once I got a little older and realized the world wasn’t so pretty. I went through some serious bouts with my mental health and at times I felt like giving up completely. With some help from family, friends, and a very talented support team, I’ve been able to make many changes that allowed me to love myself more and grow. I have some new challenges now, as becoming an adult is scary and everyone seems like they’re out to get me and watch me fail. I have to remind myself that I have many people who love me and would like nothing more than to see me suceed. I have a long way to go and a lot I want to get done before I go, but at the rate I’m going now, I’ll get that done and more!

                <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you say is very well
                        founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance
                        of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I
                        understood...” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his
                        collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria--“I
                        understood, a drawer...”</p>

                    <p>But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity.
                    </p>

                    <p>“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table
                        and still covered with the sheet.</p>

                    <p>He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I could hear his teeth
                        grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew
                        alarmed both for his life and reason.</p>

                    <p>“Compose yourself,” said I.</p>

                    <p>He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the
                        sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat
                        petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have
                        you a graduated glass?” he asked.</p>
