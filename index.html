                    <li>financially secure</li>
                    <li>free from my emotions and anxiety</li>

                <p>
                    I made my avitar happy not because I'm a happy person, but because I want to be. In reality I'm
                    scared to death of eveyone around me. By making my avitar happy, I make that my reality. I believe
                    that if you speak what you want into reality, it becomes more possible! I want to be a good person
                    and trying to relate to people I cant relate to has gotten me into trouble before. I cannot relate
                    to everyone and there are people I can't help. Don't let me in on any secrets, I would perfer to be
                    blissfuly ignorant.

                <p>
                    Head down running from the beast<br>
                    Breakneck speed taking all my breath<br>
                    Black feet scraped and scarred and dripping blood<br>
                    Rain come down take me with your flood<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came to and I was running from you<br>
                    Feel your breath on the back of my neck<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where have I come to be<br>
                    Is this all that's left for me<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish that I was still there<br>
                    I want to keep on breathing<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bulls roar loud<br>
                    Snakes move past my feet<br>
                    No teeth no hands set me free<br>
                    Bones start rattling 'round inside my head<br>
                    I don't know if I'm alive or dead<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where have I come to be<br>
                    Is this all that's left for me<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish that I was still there<br>
                    I want to keep on breathing<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dig deep kicking up rock and dirt and sand<br>
                    Out of this lifeless valley bones in hand<br>
                    Over these mountains to the seas of life<br>
                    Leave this desert for the sick and damned<br>
