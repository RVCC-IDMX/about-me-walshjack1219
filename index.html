                    I made my avitar happy not because I'm a happy person, but because I want to be. In reality I'm
                    scared to death of eveyone around me. By making my avitar happy, I make that my reality. I believe
                    that if you speak what you want into reality, it becomes more possible! I want to be as good of a
                    person I can be.

                <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you say is very well
                        founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance
                        of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I
                        understood...” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his
                        collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria--“I
                        understood, a drawer...”</p>

                    <p>But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity.
                    </p>

                    <p>“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table
                        and still covered with the sheet.</p>

                    <p>He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I could hear his teeth
                        grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew
                        alarmed both for his life and reason.</p>

                    <p>“Compose yourself,” said I.</p>

                    <p>He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the
                        sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat
                        petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have
                        you a graduated glass?” he asked.</p>
